This is just to remind me, cause I keep forgetting.

To run this project, you need the following jars added in eclipse (or on your classpath):

Ice.jar
v4l4.jar
jna.jar (?)
javacv.jar (?)

For the v4l4 jar, you also need to set its native libary location to /usr/lib/jni/.

You also need to add the "Topics" folder - $SDP_HOME/src/Topics as an external folder,
and you may have to set its native library location to the WorldStateTopic folder within
that folder (it seems to just... depend.)
