This the vision system for SDP group 3.

It is currently detached from the ICE communication system. To examine how it
hooked into ICE, look for the "standalone" git tag and examine the commit prior
to the tag. Pay close attention to the README there, which explains which ICE
folders/libraries need to be on the classpath/librarypath. (For a guide to 
using git tags, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=git+tag).

To compile the vision system code, just run './compile.sh'.

To run the visiom system code, run './runVision.sh'.
